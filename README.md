# Summary

Classical Chinese Universal Dependencies Treebank annotated and converted by Institute for Research in Humanities, Kyoto University.

# Introduction

This Treebank is taken under the full text of "Mencius" (14 volumes). In Classical Chinese we had no spaces or punctuations between words or sentences, so we did not include any spaces or punctuations in Treebank files:

* UD_Classical_Chinese-Mencius-orig.conllu: Original UD of "Mencius", divided into paragraphs. Multiple roots are allowed. (not-to-release)
